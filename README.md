# Bahrain Public Bus Optimization
An optimization system I made for the public bus system in the Kingdom of Bahrain as part of a hackathon I participated in. 

## Methodology
The system uses the Google Maps API to calculate the distance as well as the time taken to travel between each bus stop as opposed to calculating their displacements, and then using this distance and time, the optimal bus route is chosen and plotted on Google Maps using the same API.

I created two datasets from scratch, for two bus routes in Bahrain, namely U1 and U2, and then applied the system on these datasets to get the proposed optimized route which saved about 24 minutes with a 16.55% decrease in time taken on average.
